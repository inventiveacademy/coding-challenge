# Coding Challenge

Choose the track you want to move your car along by toggling an option from the drop down in the upper left corner where it says "Choose Game".

If you choose "Simple Track" for example, you will see a green grassy field with a long black road extending from left to right. There is a "START" and a "FINISH" identified on the track.  There is also a red car.

You can then enter one of the several code function names into the "Type your code here!" box.  This game will iterate over and over (a simple loop) and run your code each time.  If, for example, you typed "driveSouth()" in the code box and clicked the start button (in the upper left), your car would move from the top of the page to the bottom of the page.  Go ahead and give this a try!

If your car moved from the top of the page to the bottom of the page, you have successfully entered your code.  Now click the Stop button (this stops the loop from executing).  Then click the Reset button (this resets the chosen track).

Now you can attempt to solve the track that you see.  The object of the game is to get your car to stay on the road and move from the START line to the FINISH line.  How you move your car is up to you.  You can write any javascript you want in the window provided.  Or you can use the properties and functions provided to you.  

The available properties and functions are written out for you and described in the lower right corner of the window, just under the code text box.

Once you solve the "Simple Track", try to solve a more complicated track.

Good luck!
